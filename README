I created a port scanner in python several months ago for fun and figured porting this to C++ would be a good project.
Python was way easier... I was able to find an algorithm on StackOverflow for the logic to check is a port is open. I
was able to improve that and add my own logic to handle the 2 flags and user-input errors.
